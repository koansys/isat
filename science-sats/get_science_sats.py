# Parse the CSV of Science satellites SMD wants by name,
# find satelite ID from Celestrak files.
# The names are unlikely to match perfectly -- parenthetical suffixes, etc

# The CSV is (typical) a visually-formatted file with:
#   HEADER LINE
#   Division, Name, Stuff
#   Description, stuff
# We will have to do some annoying parsing to get the right lines.

# The TLE file is sets of 3 lines with Name, TLE1, TLE2; ID is 2nd field sans U
#   GALILEO-PFM (GSAT0101)
#   1 37846U 11060A   12293.53312491  .00000049  00000-0  00000-0 0  1435
